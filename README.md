# Customer-Retention-Analysis
Identifying the causes of customer churn and how to address them.
A few key insights:
41.89% of fiber optic customers were churning - why?
Month-to-Month contract showes a 40% churn rate-room for better incentives?
Customers using electronic payment methods were leaving more-what's driving this?
I suggested strategies like offering contract-based discounts and improving support for fiber optic users to boost retention.
