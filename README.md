# ðŸ”„ Customer Retention Analysis

An analysis exploring **customer churn** for a telecom / subscription-service provider, with a special focus on identifying root causes of churn and recommending strategies to improve retention.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Objectives

- Quantify the **churn rate** overall and for specific segments (e.g. by contract type, service type).  
- Identify which customer groups are most at risk of leaving (e.g. fiber-optic users, month-to-month contract subscribers, users of certain payment methods).  
- Explore correlations / drivers of churn: customer demographics, service usage, payments mode, contract types, etc.  
- Visualize churn trends and retention metrics to aid decision-making.  
- Suggest actionable strategies to reduce churn and improve customer loyalty.

---

## ðŸ§° Tools & Data

- **Power BI** dashboard (`pwc_tasks.pbix`) to interactively explore churn metrics.  
- Visualizations and graphics (e.g. `customer_retention.PNG`) illustrating key findings.  
- Data analytics (possibly using SQL / Excel / BI tools) by segment and variable.  

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings

- ~ **41.89%** of *fiber-optic* service customers are churning â€” indicates service type is a significant factor.  
- Month-to-month contracts show roughly **40% churn**, which suggests loyalty / switching incentives are weak.  
- Customers paying via **electronic methods** have higher churn â€” possible areas: payment processing issues, perceived cost, trust / glitches.  

---

## ðŸš€ Recommendations / Strategies

Based on the analysis, proposed ways to reduce churn:

- Offer **contract-based discounts** or perks for month-to-month users to incentivize longer commitments.  
- Improve customer support / quality of service particularly for fiber-optic customers.  
- Review and optimize electronic payment processes: ease of use, reliability, trust.  
- Consider loyalty programs or retention incentives (e.g. bundled services, rewards) for at-risk segments.
